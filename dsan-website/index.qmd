Hello! Iâ€™m originally from Dhaka, the vibrant capital city of Bangladesh. I came to the US in 2015 in pursuit of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and lived in West Michigan before moving to Northern Virginia in 2022. Before joining Georgetown, I worked as a Computer Engineer, and a Data Analyst. 

I am currently pursuing a Master's of Science in Data Science & Analytics at Georgetown University. As I progress in my career, my passion lies in leveraging tailored data and algorithms to solve intricate business problems and communicating complex insights to non-technical stakeholders.

I love spending time in charming cafes and exploring new cuisines. During my downtime I enjoy reading, painting and watching movies/TV shows.
