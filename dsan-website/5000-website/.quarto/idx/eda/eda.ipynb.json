The comparison shows a stark contrast in the stock price trajectories of the two companies during this period.\n\n## Correlation Analysis\n\nThe scatter plot displays a positive correlation between \"TSLA\" and \"STLA\" stock values. As the \"TSLA\" value increases on the x-axis, the \"STLA\" value typically rises on the y-axis, with some variability.\n\nBased on the correlation heatmap, it can be said that the stock prices of the different care brands are mostly negatively correlated.\n\n## Hypothesis Generation\n\nBased on the different visualizations above, an apt hypothesis to test out could be \"TSLA's significant price surge in 2023 suggests a dominant market influence, potentially driving similar trends in associated automotive stocks\"\n\n## Data Grouping and Segmentation\n\nThe visualization displays three distinct clusters of data points based on TSLA and GM stock values. Cluster 0 primarily represents data points where both TSLA and GM have lower stock values, Cluster 1 captures instances with mid-range values, and Cluster 2 comprises of higher TSLA stock values with varying GM values. The spread of the clusters suggests a potential relationship or pattern between the stock values of TSLA and GM over the period of 2023\n\n## Identifying Outliers\n\nHere we can see the distribution of outliers for various automotive stock attributes. Most stocks, like GM, TM, NSANY, MBGYY, BMWYY, and POAHY, have a narrow range of outlier values, typically below 100. Notably, TM displays a compact outlier range between 100 and 150, while two instances of TSLA stock demonstrate a broader range of outliers, with one reaching up to 300 and another clustering around 150 to 200.\n\n## Report and discussion of methods and findings\n\n| Topic                                       | Description                                                                                                   | Methods  |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| **Correlation Matrix**                      | The matrix depicts correlations between various stock tickers.
