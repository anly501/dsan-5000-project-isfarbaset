In general this may or may-not be true.\nBut these labels should not be used as part of the clustering analysis.\n\n### Feature Selection\n\n(optional)\nIf you want, you can perform filter based feature selection on your data-set \n as a pre-processing step before clustering\nYou can also use optimal feature sets obtained during previous assignments\n\n\n### Hyper-parameter tuning\n\nFor each of the three clustering algorithms, perform any relevant parameter tuning in an attempt to achieve the optimal clustering results\ne.g. For k-means, Use Elbow and Silhouette methods to illustrate the ideal number of clusters. Visualize your results.\nAlso, when relevant, explore different choices of distance metric for the algorithm. Which distance metric seems to works best in which cases and why?\n\n### FInal Results\n\nOnce you have everything “dialed in”, re-do the analysis one last time with the optimal parameter choice to get your “final results”.\n\n## Results\n\nUsing your “final results”, discuss, illustrate, and compare the results of your various clustering analysis methods.\nWhich method seemed to work the best and why, which was easier to use or preferable, etc.\nCan you make connections between the optimal cluster predictions, after parameter tuning, with any of the labels in the data set. Do they coincide? Why or why not?\nDid the clustering results provide any new insights into your data?\nExplore the results, and create as many meaningful visualizations as you need. Be creative, and experiment with different image aesthetics.\nEnsure all visualizations are professional, ascetically pleasing, labeled, captioned, use color, are clear, and support your discussion and goals.\n\n## Conslusions\n\nIn this section, the goal is to summarize & wrap-up the report.
