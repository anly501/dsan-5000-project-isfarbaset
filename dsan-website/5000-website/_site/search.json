    "text": "Introduction:\nThe data question Iâ€™m seeking to explore is related to Electric Vehicles: their environmental impact, market share, and performance compared to gasoline vehicles. Over the past few years, auto manufacturers have started to add EVs to their lineup in an effort to meet the rising demand. This shift in consumer demand gives rise to many interesting questions to explore."

    "text": "Academic Journal Research:\nThe incentive presented by the government greatly impacts the demand of EVs. Government regulation and environmental prospect, in particular will drive the adoption of transportation electrification (Yong et al. 2015). The environmental benefits of EVs immensely influence their dominance in the market. Electrifying transportation is a promising approach to alleviate the climate change issue (Yong et al. 2015).\nStudies are being carried out to analyze the impact of EVs take up, with focus on economic, environment and technical issues on power grids (Situ 2009). It will lso be intersting to observe the efforsts made by the US to promote EVs compared to the rest of the world and how swiftly these vehicles can become ubiquitous. In fact, as OEM introduce more EV model to the end consumer by 2012, the presents of electric vehicle will be widely seen and recognized (Situ 2009)."
